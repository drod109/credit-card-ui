## My process

I took my inspiration from [CoddingNepalWeb's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUMqJMkwOBY) video. I want to see if I could duplicate the design pattern after viewing the video a single time. This was a little more challenging because I didn't use a screenshot during this coding and styling session which did add more time to the completion but I was worth it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
